# Social_io
[Social_io](http://caioakira.pythonanywhere.com/) is a simple social media website created primarily with Django. All the pages in it were created with Django templates with the help of vanilla Javascript for asynchronous loading.

The website features basic social media functionality, allowing the user to create text posts, like and comment on said posts, edit their profile (name, profile picture and bio), as well as follow and unfollow users.

The goal of this project was to obtain a clearer understanding of relational databases, queries, and user authentication models.
